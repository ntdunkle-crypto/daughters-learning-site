I'm sorry for the confusion and frustration—let's fix this step-by-step with a simplified, fully working website tailored for your 5-year-old daughter, ensuring it’s biblically based, meets Pennsylvania homeschool requirements, and is easy for you to set up as a complete beginner on Linux Mint. I'll explain everything like you're brand new to this, avoid technical jargon, and provide exact files to copy-paste. We'll create a basic but functional site with working buttons, games, text-to-speech (TTS), answer tracking, and videos. Then, I'll guide you through hosting it on GitHub Pages with clear, dummy-proof instructions.

The issue with buttons not working likely stems from:
- Incorrect file paths (e.g., `styles.css` or `script.js` not linking properly).
- Missing or incomplete files in your project folder.
- Errors in copying or folder structure when pushing to GitHub.
- Browser issues (TTS or buttons failing due to permissions or compatibility).

We'll rebuild from scratch with a minimal setup (one game per subject, one video) to ensure it works, then you can add more later. I'll include all necessary files and exact terminal commands.

### Step 1: Understand What We’re Building
Your website will have:
- **Home Page**: A colorful welcome screen with a Bible verse and buttons to pick subjects (English, Math, etc.).
- **Subject Pages**: One page per subject (e.g., English, Math) with:
  - A multiple-choice game (e.g., "What sound does 'A' make?").
  - A button to read the question aloud (TTS).
  - A short Bible-based video to reinforce learning.
- **Tracking**: A button to save answers to your computer as a file.
- **Design**: Bright colors, fun fonts, and cartoon images to keep your daughter engaged.
- **PA Compliance**: Covers required subjects (English, arithmetic, science, etc.) with biblical themes (e.g., Creation for science).
- **Hosting**: Free on GitHub Pages, accessible online.

### Step 2: Set Up Your Project Folder
1. **Create a Folder**:
   - On your Linux Mint desktop, right-click and select "Create New Folder."
   - Name it exactly: `PeytonEducation` (no spaces to make terminal commands easier).
   - Double-click to open it.

2. **Download Cartoon Images**:
   - Go to https://pixabay.com/ in your browser (Firefox is fine).
   - Search "cartoon animal" (e.g., "cartoon apple" or "cartoon sheep").
   - Download 2-3 free images (PNG format, small size <500KB to avoid GitHub issues).
   - Save them in a subfolder:
     - Right-click inside `PeytonEducation`, choose "Create New Folder," name it `images`.
     - Drag the downloaded images into `PeytonEducation/images/`.
     - Example names: `apple.png`, `sheep.png`.

3. **Install a Text Editor** (if not already done):
   - Open the "Software Manager" (search for it in the Mint menu).
   - Search for "Visual Studio Code" and install it (it’s free).
   - Or use the pre-installed "Text Editor" (gedit), but VS Code is easier for beginners.

### Step 3: Create the Website Files
We'll create a simple site with a home page and one subject page (English) to start. You’ll copy-paste the code below into files. Each file goes in the `PeytonEducation` folder unless specified.

#### File 1: Home Page (`index.html`)
This is the main page your daughter sees first.

    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>God's Fun Learning Adventure!</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">

<body>
    <header>
        <h1>Welcome to God's Learning World!</h1>
        <img src="images/sheep.png" alt="Cute Sheep" style="width:200px;">
        <p>Verse of the Day: "The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want." (Psalm 23:1)</p>
        <button onclick="speak('Hi Peyton! God loves you. Let\'s learn and have fun today!')">Listen to Greeting!</button>
    </header>
    <nav>
        <button onclick="window.location.href='subjects/english.html'">English with God</button>
        <!-- Add more subject buttons later -->
    </nav>
    <footer>
        <button onclick="downloadProgress()">Save My Progress</button>
    </footer>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
</xaiArtifact>

**How to Create**:
- Open Visual Studio Code (or Text Editor).
- Click File > New File.
- Copy-paste the above code exactly.
- Save as: `index.html` in `/home/yourusername/Desktop/PeytonEducation`.
  - In VS Code: File > Save As > navigate to `PeytonEducation` > name it `index.html`.
- Test: Double-click `index.html` in your file manager to open in Firefox. You’ll see text but no colors or working buttons yet (we need more files).

#### File 2: Styles (`styles.css`)
This makes the site colorful and fun.

body {
    background-color: #ffeb3b; /* Bright yellow */
    font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', cursive, sans-serif; /* Fun font */
    text-align: center;
    color: #333;
}

h1, h2 {
    color: #f44336; /* Red for excitement */
    animation: bounce 2s infinite; /* Bounce effect */
}

button {
    background-color: #4caf50; /* Green buttons */
    color: white;
    padding: 15px;
    margin: 10px;
    border: none;
    border-radius: 10px;
    font-size: 20px;
    cursor: pointer;
}

button:hover {
    background-color: #2196f3; /* Blue on hover */
}

iframe {
    margin: 20px auto;
    display: block;
    border: 2px solid #2196f3;
}

@keyframes bounce {
    0%, 20%, 50%, 80%, 100% { transform: translateY(0); }
    40% { transform: translateY(-20px); }
    60% { transform: translateY(-10px); }
}
</xaiArtifact>

**How to Create**:
- In VS Code: File > New File.
- Copy-paste the above code.
- Save as: `styles.css` in `PeytonEducation`.
- Test: Re-open `index.html` in Firefox. It should now have a yellow background, red headings, and green buttons.

#### File 3: JavaScript (`script.js`)
This makes buttons, TTS, and answer tracking work.
